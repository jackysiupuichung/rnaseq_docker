linux command lines for ngs manipulation

Reference genome
count of each base in the entire reference genome file 
(A for loop is used to iterate over each character until the end ("NF") is reached. Again the counts for each letter are stored in a simple data structure and once the end of the file is reach the results are printed.)
cat <<.fa>> | grep -v ">" | awk '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++){a[$i]++}}END{for (i in a){print a[i], i}}' FS= - | sort -k 2 | column -t

count number of occurance of <<pattern>> present in reference genome file
cat <<.fa>> | grep -v ">" | grep -o -i <<pattern>> | wc -l

Number of repetitive elements corresponded to repetitive elements (repetitive elements in the sequence are represented in lower case)
cat <<.fa>> | grep -o '[a-z]' | wc -l

Annotations
Number of unique gene IDs are in the .gtf file
cat <<.gtf>> | grep -w gene | wc -l

Sort by chromosome name then genomic start location (numerically)
sort <<.gtf>> -k1,1 -k4,4n > gencode.v32.all.gtf

RNA-seq data
number of reads in library
zcat <<.fastq.gz>> | grep -P "read name prefix" | wc -l
